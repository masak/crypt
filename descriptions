== clearing
The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

== hill
A flat, broad hill interrupts the dense-ish forest here. Only grass and
small bushes grow on the hill.

== chamber
This is a cramped space just inside the hidden opening in the hill. The
sun gets in enough to illuminate the place. There are some scribblings on
the wall.

== hall
It's hard to believe that this kind of room can fit under a hill. It's tall,
long, and quite spacious. Hieroglyphs adorn all four of the walls. The
floor slants a bit.

== cave
This is a perfectly cylindrical chamber. An oversized fire-pit takes up most
of the floor space in the middle of the room. Ancient runes run along the
circumference of the wall. It's hot and stuffy.

== crypt
The air is stale and smells a bit metallic. Three impenetrable sarcophagi
sit next to each other on the floor. On the walls are numerous finely
inscribed ideograms.

== flashlight
The flashlight, a trusty Flexmann 520, has been serving you for countless
adventures.

== rope
The rope is 5 meters and 31 centimeters long. It's twined together from
sturdy fiber of some kind.

== brook
Clear water flows over and around a few fixed stones in the brook. It's
probably from a spring higher up in the hills somewhere. It looks chilly.

== car
Small, kind of old, and beginning to rust. But it still gets you places.

== grass
It's lustrous and, you know, green.

== bushes
Those are some seriously uninteresting bushes.

== door
It's made of stone but covered with dirt and grass on top.

== trees
Autumn trees are just so lovely. They look like they're just about to drop
all their leaves -- red, yellow, brown ones -- to the ground.

== leaves
They look like the kind of leaves that like a good rustle.

== brook
Clear water flows over and around a few stones in the brook. It most likely
comes from a spring higher up in the hills somewhere. It looks chilly.

== water
It's clear and looks chilly.

== sign
It says "LEAVE " with big, scrawly lettering. Maybe a warning or a threat.
On closer inspection, though, it looks like there might once have been one
more letter at the end, but it has since been worn away.

== basket
It's fixed to the ground under the sign. For some reason it reminds you of
objects used during religious ceremonies for offerings of different kinds.

== tiny disk
It's a bit heavy.

== small disk
It's very heavy.

== middle disk
It's enormously heavy.

== large disk
It's indescribably heavy.

== huge disk
It's so heavy that this description doesn't do its weight justice.

== fire
It's massive, and sort of yellow-red-orangeish. Also, it's really, really hot!

== helmet
Once surely part of a big metal uniform, now it's just the helmet. The visor,
seems to be fixed in place. The whole headpiece look like a big pot without a
handle. The metal is thin and light, so the helmet doesn't weigh much.

== pedestal
It's made of stone. It points up from the ground. It appears to contain a
deadly, unreachable contraption built to discourage tomb raiders.

== sarcophagi
They're boxes containing deceased people. Better just leave them be.

== butterfly
It's made of gold, silver, enamel, diamond, ruby, emerald, and various other
precious stones and metals you can't identify. You feel rich just looking
at it.

== walls:chamber
"Help, I'm stuck!"
"This sentence no verb."
"A hidden door. Oldest trick in the book."

== walls:hall
"Larry Wall was here."
"Put the huge disk on the right rod."
"$question = /2b/ || !/2b/;"
"Oh, I know, I know! It's this Hanoi thing, right?"
"You'll never make it."
"The small disk on the medium disk... no wait, hold on..."

== walls:cave
"Do not <illegible> the fire!"
"The Eternal Fire shall not be disturbed."
"For thousands of years our ancestors have tended this fire."
"If you were to put out the fire, how would you do it?"
"Under any circumstances, DO NOT <illegible>"
"Do not believe everything you read on walls."

== walls:crypt
"Man, it's depressing in here."
"I have nothing whatsoever to do."
"Ooh, nice butterfly."
"Please turn the fire back on if you're the last to leave."
"How can I get the treasure without being crushed to death?"
"Perl 6 rocks!"
"Camelia, is that you?"
