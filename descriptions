== Clearing
The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

== Hill
A flat, broad hill interrupts the dense-ish forest here. Only grass and
small bushes grow on the hill.

== Chamber
This is a cramped space just inside the hidden opening in the hill. The
sun gets in enough to illuminate the place.

== Hall
It's hard to believe that this kind of room can fit under a hill. It's tall,
long, and quite spacious. Hieroglyphs adorn all four of the walls.

== Cave
This is a perfectly cylindrical chamber. An oversized fire-pit takes up most
of the floor space in the middle of the room. Ancient runes run along the
circumference of the wall. It's hot and stuffy.

== Crypt
The air is stale and smells a bit metallic. Three impenetrable sarcophagi
sit next to each other on the floor. On the walls are numerous finely
inscribed ideograms.

== flashlight
The flashlight, a trusty Flexmann 520, has been serving you for countless
adventures.

== rope
The rope is 5 meters and 31 centimeters long. It's twined together from
sturdy fiber of some kind.

== brook
Clear water flows over and around a few fixed stones in the brook. It's
probably from a spring higher up in the hills somewhere. It looks chilly.
